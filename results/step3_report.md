# Step 3 — XAI Implementation Report
**Date:** 2026-06-03 / 2026-06-04
**Branch:** xai-features
**Status:** COMPLETE — all checks passed
**Step 3.5:** SKIPPED — see PIPELINE.md and Step 10a

---

## Objective

Implement the three XAI components needed for Step 4 onward:
1. Integrated Gradients (IG) — gradient-based attribution over the 10 path scalars
2. KernelSHAP — perturbation-based attribution, black-box GNN wrapper
3. Random-ranking control — deterministic negative control (seed=42, conditional §7.B)

Plus: compute and cache the training-set per-feature medians used as the
baseline/background reference for both IG and KernelSHAP.

## Bug Encountered: training_stats.py ran for 162 minutes (no cap)

**What happened:** The first run of `training_stats.py` was launched without a
`max_sims` limit over the full `all_multiplexed` training split. The training
set contains 15,039 simulations across two topology folders (`geant2-multiplexed`
11,992 sims, `nsfnet-multiplexed` 3,047 sims). At ~0.3s per simulation on CPU,
iterating the full set would take ~75 minutes minimum. Due to Python stdout
buffering in the background process, no progress output appeared in the log,
making the process look frozen. The user stopped it after ~162 minutes.

**Fix:** Added `max_sims=500` as the default cap in `compute_training_stats()`.
500 simulations × ~272 flows/sim = ~136,000 values per feature — more than
sufficient for a stable median estimate. The script completed in ~3 minutes.

**Important distinction (locked per user confirmation):**
- 500 sims cap → ONLY for computing background medians (statistical summary)
- Full 15,039 sims → Step 7 retrainings ONLY (never capped)
These two budgets never mix.

## Training-Set Medians (results/training_stats.json)

Computed from 500 simulations of `all_multiplexed` training split, shuffle=False.

| Feature | Median | Mean | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| traffic | 576.831 | 671.757 | kbps — dominant CBR bandwidth |
| packets | 0.577 | 0.672 | pkts/s |
| eq_lambda | 565.296 | 661.129 | equivalent arrival rate |
| avg_pkts_lambda | 0.000 | 0.264 | on/off feature — 0 for CBR flows |
| exp_max_factor | 0.000 | 3.991 | on/off burst factor — 0 for CBR |
| pkts_lambda_on | 0.000 | 0.276 | on/off feature — 0 for CBR |
| avg_t_off | 0.000 | 1.991 | on/off feature — 0 for CBR |
| avg_t_on | 0.000 | 1.992 | on/off feature — 0 for CBR |
| ar_a | 0.000 | 0.141 | autocorrelated feature — 0 for CBR |
| sigma | 0.000 | 0.301 | modulated feature — 0 for CBR |

The 6 on/off + autocorrelated + modulated features have median=0 because the
majority of flows in `all_multiplexed` are CBR — those features are structurally
zero for CBR flows. This is expected and is handled correctly: when IG
interpolates from median (0) to actual (0 for CBR, non-zero for other models),
the attribution for those features will naturally be zero for CBR flows and
non-zero for on/off/autocorrelated/modulated flows. The global ranking over
300 mixed simulations will capture the full picture.

## Sanity Check Results

### Integrated Gradients

**Test 1 — Real-data check (1 simulation, n_steps=10)**

| Feature | IG score |
|---|---|
| traffic | +0.106666 |
| packets | -0.076815 |
| exp_max_factor | -0.038298 |
| avg_pkts_lambda | +0.007850 |
| eq_lambda | -0.000522 |
| pkts_lambda_on / avg_t_off / avg_t_on / ar_a / sigma | ~0.000000 |

Result: all finite, multiple non-zero. **PASSED.**

**Test 2 — Synthetic check (traffic set to 50x median)**

traffic ranked #1 with |score|=19.634, all others = 0.000. **PASSED.**

---

### KernelSHAP

**Test 1 — Real-data check (1 simulation, nsamples=32)**

| Feature | SHAP score |
|---|---|
| traffic | +0.096289 |
| packets | -0.071080 |
| exp_max_factor | -0.032353 |
| avg_pkts_lambda | +0.006493 |
| eq_lambda | -0.000454 |
| pkts_lambda_on / avg_t_off / avg_t_on / ar_a / sigma | 0.000000 |

Result: all finite, multiple non-zero. **PASSED.**

**Test 2 — Synthetic check (traffic set to 50x median)**

traffic ranked #1 with |score|=18.978, all others = 0.000. **PASSED.**

---

### Random Control

Two calls to `random_ranking(seed=42)` produce identical output:
`['avg_t_on', 'avg_pkts_lambda', 'eq_lambda', 'ar_a', 'pkts_lambda_on',
'avg_t_off', 'sigma', 'exp_max_factor', 'traffic', 'packets']`

Determinism confirmed. **PASSED.**

---

## Notable Observations

1. **IG and KernelSHAP agree on ranking direction on this one simulation:**
   traffic (#1) > packets (#2) > exp_max_factor (#3) > avg_pkts_lambda (#4).
   This is physically sensible: traffic (bandwidth) and packet rate drive queueing
   delay in an M/D/1 or M/G/1 sense. This alignment is encouraging but draws on
   one simulation only — the full 300-sim ranking (Step 5) is what counts.

2. **Zero-median features score zero on CBR-dominated simulations:** Features
   like avg_t_on, ar_a, sigma have median=0 and are structurally 0 for CBR flows.
   IG attribution = (x_i - x'_i) * integrated_grad = (0 - 0) * grad = 0.
   This is mathematically correct, not a bug. These features will show non-zero
   attributions on the on/off and autocorrelated flows in the 300-sim run.

3. **IG and KernelSHAP magnitudes are close:** IG gives |traffic|=0.107,
   KernelSHAP gives 0.096. For the synthetic test: IG=19.63 vs SHAP=18.98.
   The methods are converging on the same answer on this one flow, which is a
   good sign for ranking stability.

## Verdict

Step 3 is complete. All implementations are correct and tested.
The XAI methods are ready for Step 4 (running on 300 all_multiplexed simulations).

Step 3.5 (pre-registration) is SKIPPED per IMT directive.
Retrospective plausibility analysis will be done in Step 10a.
